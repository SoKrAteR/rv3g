                        R3G has a very high level of education. Each subject is given due attention, and the teachers know their stuff and can explain the material well. Usually we have 9 lessons every day, and in my opinion this is the optimal number, because we are given less homework, and I think that it’s better to have everything explained at school than to spend several hours at home struggling with homework.
